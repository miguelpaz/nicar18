White House visitros list updated 
bit.ly/2Frudpe
CIA world leaders list 
bit.ly/2Hju6IX

put it in the folder
go ls

1. - Exact matches
2 files and the name is written in the same way
How many names on the Forbes world billionaires list are also in the China's billionaires list?

first csv match

csvmatch \
forbes-billionaires.csv \
forbes-china-billionaires.csv \
--fields1 name \
--fields2 name

the \ works to tell the command line you are not done yet
Type it out in the command line and see what you get

next step
all in the terminal and we 
this --fields1  is a flag to specity what column to use, flags can be written in two ways the liong way with 2 dashes --fields1 or the short way -1 or -A (single letter or number)

If you press UP in terminal will show you what was the last thing you did.

Lets add the names we matched in the billionaires-from-chinca.csv file
csvmatch \
forbes-billionaires.csv \
forbes-china-billionaires.csv \
--fields1 name \
--fields2 name
> billionaires-from-chinca.csv

press enter, now we want to rank?

$ csvmatch forbes-billionaires.csv forbes-china-billionaires.csv --fields1 name --fields2 name --output 1.name 1.realTimeRank > billionaires-from-china.csv

2. NAIVE APPROACHES TO FUZZY 
Ignoring things like 
uppercase
common name prefixes (Mr. Ms., etc)
other domain-specific words
non-alpphanumerics
non-latin characters
order the words are in
IMPORTANT FOR EACH ONE THERE IS A FLAG

Example 
Orban, Viktor
Viktor Orban

How do we match it up? Lets try it out.
Whuch names from the CIA world leaders list are also in the White House guest list
lets open both csv's with open name of file and tab

users-Mac-mini-2:Finding_needles_in_haystacks_with_fuzzy_matching_1239 user$ open cia-world-leaders.csv 
users-Mac-mini-2:Finding_needles_in_haystacks_with_fuzzy_matching_1239 user$ open white-house-visitors2.csv
The file /Users/user/Desktop/hands_on_classes/Finding_needles_in_haystacks_with_fuzzy_matching_1239/white-house-visitors2.csv does not exist.
users-Mac-mini-2:Finding_needles_in_haystacks_with_fuzzy_matching_1239 user$ ls
billionaires-from-china.csv	forbes-billionaires.csv		un-sanctions-jan-2018.csv
billionaires-from-chinca.csv	forbes-china-billionaires.csv	white-house-visitors-2.csv
cia-world-leaders.csv		forbes-forbes-400.csv		white-house-visitors.csv
users-Mac-mini-2:Finding_needles_in_haystacks_with_fuzzy_matching_1239 user$ white-house-visitors-2.csv
-bash: white-house-visitors-2.csv: command not found
users-Mac-mini-2:Finding_needles_in_haystacks_with_fuzzy_matching_1239 user$ open white-house-visitors-2.csv



now run 

csvmatch \
cia-world-leaders.csv \
white-house-visitors-2.csv \
--fields1 leader_name \
--fields2 visitors_name \
--ignore-case \
> leaders-visiting-trump.csv


-LEVENSHTEIN fuzzy algorithm

Max Harlow = Max Harkow ?
>> 90% the same

Max Harlow = John Dales ?
>> 10% the same because the L is in last name in same place

SO lets find

csvmatch \
cia-world-leaders.csv \
forbes-china-billionaires.csv \
--fields1 leader_name \
--fields2 name \
--fuzzy levenshtein \
> billionaires-chinese-leaders.csv

-METHAPHONE fuzzy algorithm

Catherine = Kathryn ? If it sounds the same is a match
>> YES THE SAME

David = Dave ?
>> NO!

Which world leaders from the CIA list are also on the United Nations sanction list


-BILENKO fuzzy algotihtm * machine learning

Bult for deduping data and doing fuzzy matchning

John Kennedy = Jim Kennedy ?
>> Thinhs and asks you questions
Rob Ford = Robert J Ford ?
>> things and asks you questions

Which names from the CIA world leaders list are on the White House visitros list? With the power of machine learning

csvmatch \
cia-world-leaders.csv \
white-house-visitors-2.csv \
--fields1 leader_name \
--fields2 visitor_name \
--fuzzy bilenko \
> leaders-visiting-trump-3.csv

CAVEATS
Same name does not mean same person, medium size data only, every row needs to be matched against every other row
To work out how many comparisons that means take the number of rows in the two files and multiply them
Both files need to be loaded in the cimputers memory to work
